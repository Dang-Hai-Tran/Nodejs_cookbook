The Node.js fs module provides APIs that can be used to alter the permissions on a given file. As with many of the other fs functions, there is both an asynchronous API, chmod(), and an equivalent synchronous API, chmodSync(). Both functions take a file path and mode as the first and second arguments, respectively. The asynchronous function accepts a third parameter, which is the callback function to be executed upon completion.
Important note
chmod is a command that is used to change access permissions of file system objects on Unix and similar operating systems. If you're unfamiliar with Unix file permissions, it is recommended you refer to the Unix manual pages (https://linux.die.net/man/1/chmod).
