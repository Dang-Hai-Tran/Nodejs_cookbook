Gold IRA is an individual retirement account that allows you to invest in gold and other precious metals such as silver and palladium.
Investing in gold can afford you certain advantages that will help your portfolio perform well and earn you long-term returns.
Here are three reasons why investing in gold through a Gold IRA is a smart financial move:

1. Safeguard against inflation
Investing in a Gold IRA will protect you against inflation because as the dollar goes down, gold has a tendency to increase in value because it's a dollar-denominated commodity.
Essentially, your gold account will serve as a safeguard against moves by the Federal Reserve that may have an impact on inflation and the economy.
